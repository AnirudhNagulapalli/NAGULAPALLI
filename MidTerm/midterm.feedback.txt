Anirudh,

I could not find the .pdf document corresponding to your midterm exam.

Here is your feedback and grade breakdown by problems:

1) The experiments seem ok, except that you may not have given the perceptron
enough time to make progress after the linear regression starting point. What
if 1000 wasn't enough? -1pt
You did not explain the results. -5pts
You did not report E_out. -5pts

2) Why is your code not commented? -2pts

3) Good picture/drawing.


Peace,

- Dr. Rivas
